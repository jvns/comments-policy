# comments-policy

This blog has some unusual commenting guidelines. Please take a couple of minutes to read them! The goal of this blog is to teach people about programming & systems in a positive & friendly way and the comments have the same goal.

I'm introducing a way to comment because I know there are a lot of knowledgeable and thoughtful people who read this blog and I'd like to hear more of what you have to say. I think of blogging as a **conversation**. One of my favorite-ever things was when I wrote [Why do we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/30/why-do-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack/) and Marek Majkowski from Cloudflare wrote [Why we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack/) in response.

I'm interested in discussions that are about learning new things (not arguing about who is "right" or "wrong"), so I decided to write down explicitly the kinds of comments I'd like to see.

So! Here are the kinds of contributions I'd like:

1. **new information** about the subject of the post. Some examples of this include:
  * "you mentioned you're struggling to learn iptables, <link> really helped me learn iptables"
  * this post talked about how to use cgroups but not about how they work! How cgroups work is really interesting and here's how!
  * "you said you don't really know if X is useful. I use X all the time at work, here are some reasons I use it and why I like it!"
1. **questions**. I think that great questions are just as important as new information. If a blog post brings up a question that you've always had but haven't been able to figure out, ask! Maybe we can make progress on it!
1. **experience reports**. I think there's a lack of good stories about how people are using technology. If I write about some technology and you have a great story about your experience (eg "we wrote our own TCP stack and it [was harder than expected](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12021499)"), please share it!
1. **corrections**. I often say things that are wrong on this blog. I'm generally more interested in substantial corrections than minor nitpicks. Don't be mean about it, obviously.
1. **awesome links**. Links to other interesting reading that others may not have read is always appreciated. 
1. **long replies**. I'm especially interested in replies that took you at least 5 minutes to write (more than off-the-cuff pithy comments, that's what Twitter is for :))

What's not appropriate:

* opinions that aren't backed up by facts. I'm pretty interested in hearing about your **experiences** ("I used X and it was a bad experience because of A, B, and C"), but not so much unsubstantiated opinions ("X is terrible software and nobody should use it")
* being rude or insulting.
* comments that are funny but not informative

I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
